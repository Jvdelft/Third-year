# Third Year Projects
Those are the projects from my last year of Bachelor at ULB. I will quickly explain each of them in the following sections.

# Beacon Project
It was a project using a PSoC controller. There were several events and interrupts to deal with. The idea was to code a beacon able to transcribe messages in Morse using sound and light.
The device needed also to transcribe the messages in semaphore codes with flags. The results are shown in the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MYAr8kZhR8

# English Technical Report
A report focused on the quality of English. The theme was a well-known topic of fluid mechanics, the Pitot Tube for velocity measurements.
This project was used to assess the quality of our English while writing precise, technical texts.
